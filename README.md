# savelock
Prevents loading save files of uninstalled mods.

Usage:
1. Place the script file in `scripts/vscripts/`.
2. Name it something unique and specific to the mod you're guarding. The script can read its own file name.
3. Run it, ideally just once. Examples of what works include: `mapspawn.nut`, `logic_script`, `logic_auto`, etc.
